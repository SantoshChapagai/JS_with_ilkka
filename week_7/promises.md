# Promise API

for asynchronous operations

- Promise class
    -   Promise.resolve
    -   Promise.reject
    -   Promise.all

usage with:

## then-catch chain

or 

## async-await structure
(includes normal try-catch)

Promise has two endstates:
-   resolve  (handled with then)
-   reject   (with catch)

And when the promise hasn't reach to the endstate yet, it is in pending state.
